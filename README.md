# Math-Calculation
A local education company has approached you to develop a software solution to assist primary school students with their math studies. They need an application that generates random arithmetic problems appropriate for each student's level.

The application should be user-friendly for students from Reception to Year 7 (ages 5 to 12). It will be a text-based program that presents a math problem and allows the student to type their answer. The application will immediately confirm if the answer is correct or incorrect and keep track of the student's overall accuracy, which will be reported at the end of the session with appropriate feedback. The session length should be selectable at the beginning, with options for 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 questions.

The following considerations should be addressed at the start of each session via numbered menus:

Student Level:

Reception: Only addition
Years 1 - 2: Addition and subtraction
Years 3 - 4: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Years 5 - 6: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Year 7: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo (division with remainder, presented as xry, where x is the quotient and y is the remainder, e.g., 10 % 3 = 3r1)
Session Length:

10 questions
20 questions
30 questions
40 questions
50 questions
The number range used for problems will depend on the selected year level:

Range	Year Level
0 → 9	Reception
0 → 9	Years 1 - 2
0 → 99	Years 3 - 4
-999 → 999	Years 5 - 6
-9999 → 9999	Year 7
